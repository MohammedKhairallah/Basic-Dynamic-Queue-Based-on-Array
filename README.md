# Basic-Dynamic-Queue-Based-on-Array

This project showcases the implementation of a dynamic queue using an array in the C programming language. A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. In a dynamic queue, the size of the queue is not fixed and can dynamically grow or shrink as elements are enqueued or dequeued.

## Features:

- **CreateQueue:** Create a queue object in the heap to hold queue information.

- **EnqueueElement:** Add elements to the end of the queue.

- **DequeueElement:** Remove elements from the front of the queue.

- **GetQueueCount:** Retrieve the current count of elements in the queue.

- **QueueFront & QueueRear:** Retrieve the front and rear elements without removal.

- **DestroyQueue:** Release memory and destroy the queue.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Each function is thoroughly documented for ease of understanding and usage.
